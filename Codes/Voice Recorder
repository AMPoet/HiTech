# Audio Recorder with Python 🏆🎤

This is a simple Python script that allows you to record high-quality audio and save it as a WAV file. The script utilizes `sounddevice` for recording and `tkinter` for selecting the save location.

## Features ✨
- 🎙️ **Record audio** using your microphone.
- 📁 **Save the recording** as a WAV file.
- ⏳ **Adjustable recording duration** (default: 20 seconds).
- ⚡ **High-quality** stereo recording (44.1 kHz sample rate).
- 🖱️ **Graphical file save dialog** for ease of use.

## Installation 🚀
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install sounddevice scipy
```

## Usage 🛠️
Run the script in a Python environment:

```bash
python recorder.py
```

1. The script will **start recording** audio from your microphone.
2. After the duration ends, a **save dialog** will appear.
3. Choose a location and name for your **WAV file**.
4. 🎧 Enjoy your recorded audio!

## Code Overview 📝

### `record(duration, fs)`
- Records audio for a specified duration and sample rate.
- Returns the recorded data.

### `main()`
- Calls `record()` to capture audio.
- Opens a file dialog for saving the recording.
- Saves the file in WAV format.

## Example 🎬

```python
recorded_audio = record(duration=10, fs=44100)  # 10-second recording
write("output.wav", 44100, recorded_audio)  # Save as output.wav
```
